                IV edition of Constrói Angola ends with a positive balance
            </h3>

            <p style="color: black; text-align: justify;">
                The IV edition of the Civil Construction, Public Works and Security Fair (ConstóiAngola) held from the
                18th to the 22nd of this month, in Luanda, produced an estimated turnover of USD 120 million, surpassing
                the previous edition which had a figure of USD 100 million.<br>
                <br>
                During the five days, the 230 exhibitors from Angola, Portugal, Spain, China and Brazil presented
                products linked to civil construction and industrial safety and established an exchange between two
                companies (Tilca and H3P).<br>
                <br>
                Despite the weak turnout of the public, the visit of the acting president of the National Assembly, João
                Lourenço, animated the exhibitors. The official appealed to businessmen to bet on local production to
                facilitate the acquisition of building materials.<br>
                <br>
                From the range of companies, Odebrecht was distinguished with the prize for the best stand and
                participation, ICEP from Portugal as the best institutional participation, the company CIMACO in the
                field of construction companies, Fermat for the equipment on display, AP Service in the security area,
                Sonangol in the services sector and Tandek for innovation and technology.<br>
                <br>
                Companies also took advantage of the event to present products or announce projects. Sonangol
                Distribuidora held a seminar in which it presented the advantages of using piped gas in homes and
                buildings, an existing service in the provinces of Luanda and Cabinda.<br>
                <br>
                Odebrecht presented its project to build a shopping center in the southern zone of luanda, with 400
                stores, restaurants, cinemas, bank and travel agencies, a parking lot and entertainment, among
                others.<br>
