                competition for the best store, commercial area and Christmas window, organized by the Ministry of
                Commerce, from December 10, 2006 to January 7 of the current year.<br>

                <br>
                In a note, the national directorate of internal trade refers that the classification obeyed, among other
                criteria, the decoration of spaces, exhibition of goods and services, originality, singularity and
